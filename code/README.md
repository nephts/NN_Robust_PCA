# Neural network robust principal component analysis
Denise: Deep Learning based Robust PCA for Positive Semidefinite Matrices
Python implementation of Denise from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13612.pdf

This folder contains the model and code for training data generation as well as a implementation of the principal component pursuit algorithm. In `PCA_for_a_covariance_matrix_of_5_Dax_30_stocks_by_PCP.ipynb` the principal component pursuit is implemented and applied to financial data `Stock prices dax 30_new.csv`.

### Dependencies:
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)  
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
